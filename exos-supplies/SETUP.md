## 📁 **What We Built**

```
exos-catalog/                    ← Your existing repo (UNTOUCHED)
├── src/                         ← Original React app (STAYS LIVE)
├── firebase.json               ← Original hosting config
│
└── exos-supplies/              ← NEW Modern App
    ├── app/page.tsx            ← Main catalog page
    ├── components/ui/          ← Modern UI components
    ├── lib/firebaseService.ts  ← Database operations
    ├── .github/workflows/      ← Auto-deploy pipeline
    └── README.md              ← Full documentation
```

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

### **1. Install Dependencies & Test Locally**
```bash
cd exos-supplies
npm install                 # ✅ Already done!
npm run dev                # Start development server
```
Visit: `http://localhost:3000`

### **2. Set Up Firebase Hosting Channels**
```bash
# From the exos-supplies directory
firebase login
firebase use exos-supplies

# Configure hosting targets
firebase target:apply hosting staging exos-supplies  
firebase target:apply hosting production exos-supplies
```

### **3. Deploy to Staging**
```bash
npm run build
npm run firebase:deploy:staging
```
Your staging site will be: `exos-supplies--staging.web.app`

### **4. Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)**
Add this secret to your GitHub repository:
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EXOS_SUPPLIES`

Then pushing to main will auto-deploy to staging!

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### **Live Applications**
- **Current Production**: `exos-equipment-list.web.app` (UNTOUCHED)
- **New Staging**: `exos-supplies--staging.web.app` (when deployed)
- **New Production**: `exos-supplies.web.app` (when ready)

### **Database**
- **Reads from**: Your existing `exos-supplies` Firestore database
- **New Collection**: `gymCarts` (for the new cart system)
- **Zero impact**: On your current app's data

## 🎨 **Features Ready to Use**

### **Search-First Experience**
- Large search bar (coaches will love this!)
- Real-time filtering by name, brand, category, part number
- "Preferred Only" toggle (defaults to showing preferred items)

### **Modern Product Cards**
- Clean Sprouts-inspired design
- "+" buttons for quick adding to cart
- Cost display and category badges
- Responsive grid layout

### **Cart System**
- Per-gym cart management
- Quantity tracking
- Fixed "View Cart" button when items are added
- Persistent storage in Firestore

### **Gym Management**
- Dropdown to select current gym (MP2, MAT3, MP5, etc.)
- Cart persists per gym selection
- Real-time cart count updates

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

```bash
# Daily development
cd exos-supplies
npm run dev                    # Local development

# When ready to test
npm run build                  # Build for production
npm run firebase:deploy:staging # Deploy to staging

# When ready for production
npm run firebase:deploy:production # Deploy to production
```

## 🛠️ **What's Different from Current App**

| Feature | Current App | New Exos Supplies |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Search** | Sidebar filters | Prominent search bar |
| **UX** | Traditional table | Sprouts-inspired cards |
| **Adding Items** | Modal workflows | One-click "+" buttons |
| **Scrolling** | Infinite scroll | Search-focused (no infinite scroll) |
| **Cart** | Sidebar gym management | Dedicated cart system |
| **Tech** | React + JS | Next.js + TypeScript |
| **Styling** | CSS modules | Tailwind + shadcn/ui |

## 🚨 **Important Reminders**

- ✅ **Current app stays live**: `exos-equipment-list.web.app` is untouched
- ✅ **Same database**: Both apps read from the same Firestore
- ✅ **No Google Sheets**: New app is Firebase-only (cleaner!)
- ✅ **Safe migration**: Test everything on staging first

## 🎉 **You're Ready!**

Your modern Exos Supplies app is built and ready to deploy. The coaches will love the clean, search-first experience!

**Start with:** `npm run dev` to see it locally, then deploy to staging when ready.
